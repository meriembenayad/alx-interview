## 02- Minimum Operations

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

#### Concepts Needed:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:

   - Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
   - [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/l3JYgicNQw2Ue1Kg9jV80Q "Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)")

2. **Prime Factorization**:

   - Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

3. **Code Optimization**:

   - Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.

4. **Greedy Algorithms**:

   - The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.

5. **Basic Python Programming**:

   - Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.

### Tasks

<details>
<summary>0. Minimum Operations</summary>

In a text document, you start with a single character `H`. Your text editor can perform only two actions on this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, create a function that determines the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

- Function Signature: `def minOperations(n)`
- The function should return an integer.
- If `n` cannot be achieved, the function should return `0`.

**Example:**

For `n = 9`,

`H` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HH` => `Paste` =>`HHH` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HHHHHH` => `Paste` => `HHHHHHHHH`

The number of operations required is `6`.

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
```

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
```

**File:**

- `0-minoperations.py`
